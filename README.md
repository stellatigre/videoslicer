# videoslicer
slice videos in node using ffmpeg

#### arguments
supports two command line arguments right now:

`-i, --input` , the source file path

`-d, --duration` , the length in seconds of the video slices


Written & tested originally on my Windows machine, but should work on any of Win / OSX / Linux that has FFMPEG installed properly.
